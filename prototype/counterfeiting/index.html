  <h2><strong>(Drug) Counterfeiting</strong></h2>
  <h4><a href="http://www.gracewoo.com">Grace Woo</a>, June 2012</h4>

  <h5>Motivation</h5>

  <p>I didn't think that I would be a part of any counterfeiting initiatives
when working on <a href="#">VRCodes</a> (my PhD thesis work) in the <a
href="http://viral.media.mit.edu">Viral Spaces</a> group. The work, however,
has attracted parallels in areas of fraud protection as well as counterfeit
prevention</p>

  <p>First, I'll preface by saying that the camera-based counterfeit prevention
techniques that I'm about to describe are not the holy grail for fighting
counterfeiting. The only fool-proof way to test whether or not something is
"real" is to make a mass spectrogram test (see <a href="#">Bove</a> et al). In
other words, specifically for the problem of detecting drug counterfeiting, it
doesn't matter at the end of the day whether it's a real brand or a fake brand.
The important thing is to verify whether what you are consuming is what you
think you are consuming.</p>
  
  <h5>Challenge</h5>

  <p>However, when travelling in a third-world country and presented with two
pill bottles that look exactly identical, it is still not possible to pull out
the handheld mass spectrometer to do a quick test (yet). As a result, many are
thinking about intermediate solutions like cryptographic labels which can be
verified with a phone call or text message. <a href="http://www.mpedigree.net/mpedigree/index.php">mPedigree</a>, <a
href="http://www.the-star.co.ke/business/features/44621-sms-may-finally-beat-counterfeit-drugs-">orange SMS</a>, and <a href="http://www.pharmasecure.com/">Pharmasecure</a> are a few examples of
text-message verification systems.</p>

  <p>In fact, there are plenty of intermediary solutions that work with various
levels of security. <a href="http://www.digimarc.com">Watermarks</a> are labels
on print substrate that are difficult for the human eye to discern but can be
picked up by a camera. <a href="#">RFIDs</a> can be deployed and verified with
a handheld RFID reader.</p>

  <p>These intermediate solutions all boil down to three components. First,
it's important to have a good frontend. Frontend refers to the RFID itself, the
visual mark or the text-based input sequence. It's a lot like printing good
money. You have to make it so that it's not obvious for a human to distinguish
between a real piece of cash and a fake piece of cash. Then, you have to have a
camera be able to distinguish small perturbations that set the real mark apart
from the faked mark. All of those little details that get printed on money
serve the purpose of making it difficult to be copied by the adversary. Hence,
comparing along this dimension implies that RFID is a better solution that a
visual mark. Unfortunately, as we all know via common sense, with enough
determination nearly any tag which does not embed a secure code can be
copied.</p>

  <p>The challenge in creating a tag for counterfeit protection is that it's
not enough to make a physical tag that is hard to copy. Second, you must also
devise a method which has enough digital capacity to carry a cryptographic key.
This little bit of data is crucial. Thie piece of data should uniquely identify
the thing that is being consumed. Just like those annoying one-time use Windows
keys that you have into your "nicely-acquired" software, each object needs to
have a unique key (at the minimum) which allows the packaging to be tallied in
a centralized and verifying database when it is scanned.</p>

  <p>That is still not enough. Third, you must create a trusted network for
verification that is not entirely centralized. Just like money, the strength
and participation of the users of money helps verify whether or not the codes
in circulation are valid. Backtrack from that and it becomes obvious that you
want as many eyes as possible checking out the validity of the scanned or
swiped code.</p>

  <p>These trusted networks can be created in a variety of ways using as much
gatherable information as possible. For example, if there are a few "invalid"
codes that are captured in a particular location, there's a high chance that
everything else there is false as well. That's just one way of creating
validation. Other ways include reputation systems, social graphs and
specialized verifiers.</p>

  <p>Going back to my own thesis work, <a href="#">VRCodes</a> an example of
active visual codes which can embed digital information that takes advantage of
how the camera sees something different from what we see. For example, what may
just look like a gray surface to our eyes can actually embed a lot of data
underneath. When applied to counterfeit protection, many of the same techniques
can be used to create a "tag" that appears indistinguishable to our eyes but
actually carry cryptographic information underneath.</p>

  <p>In other words, <a href="#">VRCodes</a> can help hit two out of the three
important points. When <a href="#">VRCodes</a> are used with a verification
backend, the solution as a whole can be used to combat counterfeiting using the
existing hardware that are in people's hands.</p>

  <p>It's not easy. Even when a proposed solution fits all of the criteria from
a technical standpoint, one must make sure that the right parties are using
those tags. For example, it's not clear that the drug companies with the most
amount of money to invest in these tags/verification networks are the same ones
that have the best drugs. What happens to the non-name brands and can they
still be encouraged to create good drugs with an intermediate verification
system?</p>

  <p>The ultimate goal is to provide the highest quality product to the right
people regardless of prices and brand-recognition. The best way to do that is
empowering the user with a true physical fact-checker (see universal
tricorder).</p>
